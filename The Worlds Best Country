I used the data to showcase some of the data ones might use to determine which Country peoples are the happiest in and what 
factors might lead to happiness.
It provides an overall map of the world with colour codes of different levels of happiness.
To the right of the report are four scales that can be adjusted to show instant data manipulation and provide interactive 
result-driven output.
The centre part of the report shows population generosity as well as Gov spending on their infrastructure and quality of life.
The bottom two parts are split into Gov trust and Life Expectancy.
A correlation between the Population's Happiness, Gov Corruption, Life Expectancy and Generosity can be drawn.
