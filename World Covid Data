I used a large data set on this dashboard and experimented with different visualisation options. 
It has the ability to showcase the diffrent countries and their ability and willingness to get vaccinated and the time period it took.
The top line chart dataset, was only focused on North America and show that data can be filtered to a specific outcome to only show
relevant information. 
Bar Charts were used to indicate the vaccination rate in relation to the world.
Last but not least, the bubble chart indicate what persentage of income earners received the vaccine.
