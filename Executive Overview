We used the data to showcase some of the important metrics an Executive Team might want to see. 
It showcases the area in general, with colour codes, to emphasise sales percentages and can be translated in sec.
A sliding bar to the right can be set to the user's wishes and the data will automatically be filtered to meet the user's criteria.
The bottom half of the report is split into two sections.
Section one shows monthly sales by segment.
Section two shows sales by category.
